'''
In a separate module, define a function that 
calculates the sum of digits. Use the function 
to calculate the sum of digits entered from 
the keyboard. To do it, copy the following modules. 
Then, run the programs digits.py and myprogram.py 
separately. Try to analyze the results. 
Do you understand how to import a module and 
how to call the functions contained in the module?
